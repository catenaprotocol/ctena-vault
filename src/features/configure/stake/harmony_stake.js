        text: "You probably already knew that Beefy is the most trusted Yield optimizer for the Binance Smart Chain. But did you know that Beefy has its own token? $BIFI has a maximum supply of 80000 tokens and there is no way to mint more. Everyone who holds our own $BIFI token can not only do cool stuff like create and vote on proposals, they also get a share of all harvests done, every hour, every day on all our Harmony vaults. That's a lot of ONE that goes straight to our $BIFI holders. All you have to do is stake your $BIFI in this vault, itâ€™s that simple, come back and harvest your ONE whenever you need it!",
